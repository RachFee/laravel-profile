# laravel-profile

My very first laravel project. 

Built using Laravel 5.2, PHP 5.5.33, mySQL 

- Allows users to sign up with additional data.
- On login or successful signup, User is redirected to /profiles.
- /profiles displays list of User accounts, including additional data specified at Login.
- /profiles is accessible via menu bar at the top.
- Name is linked to user's email address.
- If valid Twitter name is provided, user's last Tweet is displayed alongside their name, linking out to Twitter.com. 
- If invalid twitter name is provided, error message is displayed instead of username.
- Twitter auth keys can be updated via config/twitter.php
- Current user is noted in the name column.

PHP unit tests are included to test redirects and account creation.

My redirects were acting a little finicky from time to time, I believe I've solved the issue, but I apologize if they fail!
